# SimulationMultiOutputPredictions
Uses a MIMO based approach for prediction of MRR, TWR and Residual Stress using transfer learning deep learning approach.

### Installation
1.) Clone the repository www.google.com or download the zip file.<br />
2.) Extract the zip file.<br />
3.) Run main.py file.

### Process
<ul>
  <li>Uses transfer learning based approach MLP Regressor for multi input multi output prediction of MRR, TWR and Residual Stress from Current, Voltage, Pulse on Time and Duty Factor.</li>
  <li>Minimised losses for effective and efficient usage.</li>
</ul>
